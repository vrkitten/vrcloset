wip resource for modding wearables in Animal Crossing: New Horizons
don't expect too much here for a while, it's literally just messy notes full of typos for now


no models for clothing? understandable. these items work just like the custom code clothing does in-game
these clothing types use a separate model because they are shared
models for accessories, shoes, hats etc. will be included in the item file because they are unique
